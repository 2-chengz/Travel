      <br><br>
      Street food can be found primarily in the two regions marked in blue below. Almost all of the street food carts are open only in
      the early afternoon to evening.
      <br>
      <br>The staff working at the street carts in Puerto Vallarta can speak really good English. The carts are fairly clean, and many offer hand sanitizer or actual sinks.
      <br>
      <br>The street carts along the beach offer
      <br>+ Elote in various flavors with mayo and cheese. This is grilled corn sliced off the cob. Some are tossed with lime and/or some type of Chile pepper, then topped with mayo and cheese. It’s the best version of corn on the cob
      <br>+ Agua frescas - flavors like lemon with chia seeds, Jamaica (hibiscus), horchata, Maracuja, and creamy strawberry
      <br>+ Cake - avoid these. Most of these are store bought and sliced up in front of you. Think Ralph’s or Costco quality cake
      <br>+ Pregnant shrimp - marinated and grilled seafood skewers
      <br>+ Hot dogs and hamburgers - thick, heavily spiced sausages sometimes wrapped in bacon and traditional or Mexican hamburgers. A Mexican hamburger is just a slice of flank steak instead of a ground beef patty
      <br>+ French fries and cut up sausages in trays
      <br>+ Fresh, homemade helados
      <br>
      <br>The street carts further in town offer
      <br>+ Tacos - asada, al pastor, chorizo, etc. as well as a variety of seafood such as grilled or battered fish, shrimp. Interestingly, lengua didn’t show up on most menus
      <br>+ Tostadas -
      <br>+ Sopes
      <br>+ Tamales
      <br>+ Churros
      <br>+ Fresh young green coconuts
      <br>+ Fresh fruit cups - strawberries, raspberries, pineapple, etc.
      <br>
      <br>Before the evening, only smoothie and fruit carts are open
      <br>
      <br>Between Thursday - Sunday, the main square in town will host even more food stands from hamburguesa (hamburgers) to enchiladas to dulce stuffed churros.
      <br>
      <br>Restaurants directly on the beach are passes for us. Most are relying entirely on their location and view to entice patrons. If that fails, they’ll try and lure you with 2x1 specials on watered down drinks or cheap beers.
      <br>
      <br>As of Nov. 2017, Yelp and TripAdvisor are currently very incomplete. There are a number of businesses with < 10 reviews or aren’t listed at all.
      <br>
      <br><h4>What to order</h4>
      Situated along the coast, Puerto Vallarta has no shortage of fresh seafood. The region is particularly famous for Aguachile, a type of raw marinated shrimp. Smoked marlin will make an appearance on a number of menus from food stands to high end restaurants.
      <br>

      <br>* notable foods in Puerto Vallarta
      <br>
      <br>El Jacalito
      <br>Massive seafood platters larger than your head for around $10
      <br>Wait time: No more than 20 minutes
      <br>Accepts credit cards: Yes
      <br>What to order:
      <br>The lobster combination platter comes with shrimp, grilled marinated chicken, and TWO lobster tails.
      There are veggies too, but I feel like it was almost a waste of time typing that out. The crispy coconut
      battered shrimp come with a dippable side of tropical mango sauce. Or get some locally caught mahi mahi
      topped with their special creamy seafood sauce; the sauce is loaded with even more seafood. The big portions
      apply to their drinks too, so feel free to indulge in their full bar.
      <br>
      <br>Coexist Bistro
      <br>Tucked inside Hotel Rio, this chill spot is perfect for brunch and is a great escape from the heat.
      <br>Wait time: No more than 15 minutes, they do take reservations
      <br>Accepts credit cards: Yes
      <br>What to order:
      <br>For a savory breakfast, you can’t go wrong with the chilaquiles or creamy shrimp enchiladas suizas or
      opt for some basic french toast or sweet crepes. For something lighter, grab a glass of fresh squeezed
      green juice or a fruit platter.
      <br><br>
      <img class="contentimage" src="pvimages/Coexist.png">
      <br>
      <br>Lamara
      <br>A must for seafood lovers, fresh bright ingredients are the focus of these creative dishes
      <br>Wait time: Either go right when they open or during off peak hours to avoid lines
      <br>What to order:
      <br>Any and all of their ceviches. The aguachiles are a must as well.
      <br><br>
      <img class="contentimage" src="pvimages/Lamara.png">
      <br>
      <br>Santo Tacote
      <br>Almost all the breakfast joints in PV are pretty touristy, and this one is no exception, but
      don’t let that detract you from the solid food.
      <br>Wait time: almost none
      <br>What to order:
      <br>Order the best of both worlds - a traditional American or authentic Mexican breakfast.
      Feel free to order classica pancakes, omelets, burgers or eat like a local and order a shrimp
      & mushroom torta, fish tacos, or their famous choirzo.
      <br>
      <br>El Carboncito
      <br>This taco shop is a favorite of locals. It is absolutely no frills but you’re here for the tacos and the tacos only!
      <br>Wait time: After 7 PM, the wait is basically nonexistent. Just grab a seat and wait till someone comes by to take your order.
      <br>What to order:
      <br>They offer typical meat options - al pastor, carne asada, chorizo, chuleta, arrachera, bistec,
      tripa, suadero - but their specialty is the al pastor. Feel free to mix and match with your favorites.
      There’s a great self serve salsa bar, and just know their hot salsa is absolute fire.
      <br><br>
      <img class="contentimage" src="pvimages/Carboncito.png">
      <br>
      <br>Churros
      <br>Just a man and his churro stand. Find him on the corner of Lazaro Cardenas and Aguacate, right by the church.
      <br>Wait time: 5-10 minutes
      <br>What to order:
      <br>Churros, obviously. Made to order you can order exactly how many you’d like for 2 pesos apiece.
      Overestimate though because they’re absolutely irresistable, piping hot they are crisp, but chewy on
      the inside with the perfect balance of sweetness. Each churro is about four inches long, not the footlong
      ones Americans are accustomed to at fairs and movie theatres.
      <br><br>
      <img class="contentimage" src="pvimages/Churros.png">
      <br>
      <br>Mariscos el Colera
      <br>Generous portions of delicious traditional food, a great laid back vibe, and wallet-friendly prices
      <br>Wait time: Almost none
      <br>What to order: Three shrimp empanadas come in an order with a side of rice and creamy salad. A side of crema
      fresca and a dash of hot sauce are the perfect complement to the flaky buttery empanada crust. The shrimp any
      style entree is an amazing deal 220 pesos for almost two dozen medium shrimp, rice, beans, salad, and garlic bread.
      Lastly, get the crab tostada for an intense sweet, tangy, savory burst of flavor.
      <br><br>
      <img class="contentimage" src="pvimages/Colera.png">
      <br>
      <br>Marisma Fish Tacos
      <br>The most famous seafood street taco cart and a place well deserving of this notoriety.
      <br>Wait time: Almost none
      <br>What to order:
      <br>You could get the grilled fish or shrimp, but that’s no way to spend your vacation! Go for that deep fried
      goodness - seafood lightly battered and fried sprinkled with some shredded cabbage on top of a fresh made tortilla.
      These are just begging for a drizzle of house made salsas. The smoked marlin tacos are very smoky, and definitely
      unique but a bit chewy and dry. I’d recommend just getting one just to try. The quesadillas are also worth ordering,
      but I’d skip the tostadas as there are just better places for that in PV.

      <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
      <br>
      <h5>There are four main regions you may choose to stay in Puerto Vallarta: The Marina, Old Vallarta,
      Zona Romantica, and the Resort Area in the south.</h5>
      <br><h4>The Marina</h4>
      + Fairly close to the airport
      <br>+ Lots of high end resorts
      <br>+ Makes sense if you will be actively boating
      <br>- Far from most of the good restaurants and activities
      <br>- Not a lot going on at night except to visit nearby hotel bars
      <br><br>
      <h4>Zona Romantica (Literally the Romantic Zone)</h4>
      + Caters toward the LGBT community. Lots of gay bars, massage parlors, and night clubs
      <br>+ Very walkable
      <br><br>
      <h4>Old Vallarta</h4>
      + Heart of the city
      <br>+ Restaurants, food stands, bars, and bakeries abound
      <br>+ About a $20 taxi from the airport
      <br>+ Very walkable
      <br>- Very touristy area
      <br><br>
      <h4>Resort Area</h4>
      + All-inclusive resorts
      <br>+ Resorts with private beaches and/or wildlife preserves
      <br>+ About a $20-30 taxi from the airport and about $10 from Zona Romantica
      <br>+ Staff at all the high end resorts can speak English wonderfully. You will not have a problem communicating
      <br>- Not much is walkable - most of the resorts take up a sizable lot and are not very close together, so it’d take quite a bit of walking to get around. It also slopes heavily downward as you go further south
      <br>
      <br>Our recommendation is to spend half of your time in Old Vallarta and the other half at a nice resort, such as Garza Blanca.
      <br>
      <br>We had an amazing experience at Garza Blanca. The views from almost every suite is incredible, even from your bathroom. You’ll feel like an honored guest as the entire staff is incredibly hospitable. The food is good for an all-inclusive. They offer activities such as paddle board lessons, kayaking and snorkeling around Los Arcos, waterfall hiking, yoga, bocce ball and more. However, if you’ve been to some of the all-inclusive in Cabo or Cancun, there are definitely fewer options both food and activity-wise. We wouldn’t recommend staying at the resort and opting out of the all-inclusive package because resort prices are quite inflated.
      <br>
      <br><h4>Resort notes</h4>
      + As part of your all-inclusive, all food, alcoholic drinks, and activities are included. There are some exceptions, such as adding on foie gras or ordering bottles of wine. When you check in, they’ll give you a sheet that outlines all the exceptions.
      <br>+ You can’t reserve restaurants or activities until you’ve checked in. We actually called beforehand to make a reservation, but when we checked in, it mysteriously didn’t exist. Make all of your reservations as soon as you check in. A dinner reservation at Hiroshi and kayaking to Los Arcos are very popular, so it may take a few days for you to get a spot.
      <br>+ Gratuity is already included as part of your all-inclusive package. You can choose to give more gratuity should you wish.
      <br><br><br><br>
    </div>
    <div class="articlecontent getaroundcontent hidden" id="articlesubcontent">
      <h3>How to get around</h3>
      <br>+ Walk - if you’re staying in Old Vallarta or Zone Romantica, everything is close enough to just walk. A perfect opportunity to happen upon an adorable cafe or hand blown glass shop
      <br>+ Taxi - taxis are very easy to find and are sometimes yellow, white, or gray/green. Taxis can be most easily found on streets closest to the beach. It’s very easy to flag a taxi, and taxi drivers are so helpful they may even approach you if they notice you looking. Be aware taxis here do not have a meter, so be sure to ask and agree upon the rate beforehand. Every single taxi we rode only accepted cash.
      <br>+ Uber - rates are often much cheaper than calling a cab, but be careful to drop your pin in the right location. The map may not clearly show some of the smaller streets
      <br>+ Bus - not recommended. While it is very cheap, bus stops aren’t clearly marked, and there aren’t benches or awnings for shade
      <br>
      <br>Definitely book airport transportation upon arrival. When you exit customs, you’ll be swarmed with people trying to sell time shares and who knows what else. It’s hard to find a taxi with no strings attached. Puerto Vallarta Tours has great rates and great service but just know you won’t get the VIP treatment with your name on a sign.
      <br><br>
    </div>
    <div class="articlecontent packcontent hidden" id="articlesubcontent">
      <h3>What to pack</h3>
      <br>- Go-pro or other waterproof camera
      <br>- Water shoes
      <br>- Sunscreen
      <br>- Sandals or flip flops
      <br>- Insect repellant
      <br>- Flowy beach dresses
      <br>- A hat or cap
      <br>- At least two bathing suits - it’s so humid, your bathing suit may take awhile to fully dry
      <br>- Backpack
      <br>- Cheap sunglasses - ones you wouldn’t mind losing if your paddle board or kayak flipped over
      <br>- Debit card without fees
      <br>- Passport
      <br>- Outlet converter - no need to bring an outlet converter if you’re coming from the U.S.

      <h4>When to go</h4>
      End of October to the beginning of November. This is a magical window after kids are in school
      and before the holidays and busy season. Flights and hotels are cheaper. Restaurants are less busy,
      and the entire town is less congested. The weather is perfect, and this is not during the rainy season.

      <h4>Other notes</h4>
      Bring the pup!
      <br>Old Vallarta and Zone Romantica are extremely dog friendly. You’ll notice people walking dogs
      on and off leash everywhere. There’s a lot of outdoor seating and most establishments allow dogs
      or even have their own store dog. You do not need to quarantine your dog if coming from the U.S.
      as long as you have your veterinarian provide a bill of health within 10 days of your trip. The
      Mexican authorities are very strict about this detail. Southwest flies to Puerto Vallarta and
      allows you to keep your dog with you in the onboard cabin.
      <br>
      <br>Register with your embassy
      <br>For U.S. citizens, it takes less than 5 minutes to register online here. In the case of an
      emergency, the embassy can reach you, provide a safe haven, and contact your family. Puerto Vallarta
      is quite safe, but this is so easy to do. It’s a no-brainer.
      <br>
      <br>Cell phone service
      <br>If you have service with Verizon Wireless, you can use your phone the same as you can at home
      without any additional charges, including data! For iPhones, you must go to settings, and turn on
      data roaming for 4G LTE. To dial a number locally in Mexico, simply type in the number area code first.
      Do not dial 1 or change the country code. To call back to the U.S., dial 001, and then the U.S. number
      area code first.
      <br>
      <br>Call your debit and credit card companies
      <br>Before you travel, let them know your travel plans, so none of your charges will be declined
      for suspicious activity.
      <br><br><br>
    </div>
    <div class="articlecontent docontent hidden" id="articlesubcontent">
    <h3>Activities</h3>
    <br>- Rescuing baby turtles with Wildlife Connection
    <br>- Zip-lining with Zip Line El Eden
    <br>- Paddle board
    <br>- Kayak to Los Arcos
    <br>- Hike
    <br>
    <h3>Souvenirs to buy</h3>
    Unlike knick knacks that will indefinitely just collect dust and wind up in your next yard sale, consumable souvenirs are always a crowd favorite.
    <br>
    <br>Tequila - Puerto Vallarta is very close to the city of Tequila, where the namesake liquor is produced. As such, there are plenty of stores offering tequila tastings and selling tequila of all prices ranges.
    <br>
    <br>Chocolate - visit the Choco Museo (literally the Chocolate Museum) for a tour outlining the history and process of chocolate. You’ll get to sample and buy chocolates made right here in Puerto Vallarta. Even better, take one of their workshops to learn how to make chocolate, ganache, truffles, or even mole
    <br>
    <br>Traditional candies - visit a number of traditional candy shops  to buy x, y, and z
    <br>
    <br>Chips - if Japan is the Mecca for unique flavored Kit Kats, then Mexico is the place to go for unique Lays, Doritos, Cheetos, and more.
